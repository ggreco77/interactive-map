# interactive-map
Basic HTML page to generate an interactive map of VLT Survey Telescope (VST) pointings.
It is an Aladin Lite application. The Field of View (FoV) sequence is provided by the python script *GWsky*.
GWsky is powered by Aladin Sky Atlas via SAMP making use of *astropy* and *healpy*.
Here the interactive maps show the VST pointing of GW 150914 and GW 151226 as reported
in the published GCN Circulars.
